            <p class="P1">As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and Delta variant virus continues to have an increased
                impact in our

            <h3 class="no cnter2 ">Wear your mask above your nose</h3>
            <p>Perhaps one of the most striking lifestyle changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandatory
                use of face masks in grocery stores, restaurants and other public places. Wearing a mask, especially
                when in close proximity to others, is imperative to slowing the spread of COVID-19. But one look outside
                of your “safe-at-home” haven and you might find people wearing masks in a variety of different styles:
                dangling from one ear, pulled down below the nose or resting below the chin. These common mistakes
                decrease the effectiveness of masking and increase the wearer’s risk of catching and spreading the
                disease.</p>

            <h3 class="no cnter2"> <span>"No"</span> to Social Gatherings During COVID-19</h3>
            <p>On the one hand, you probably have at least one family member, friend or a friend-of-a-friend who's had
                COVID-19. And, depending on where you live, COVID-19 cases may actually be back on the rise. So,
                logistically speaking, you know that attending a social gathering isn't the best idea.On the other hand,
                we're all eager to see out family and friends again. Plus, it's not like your reason for saying no is as
                simple as it was back in the old days.</p>

            <h3 class="no cnter2">Stay home if you are sick</h3>
            <p>If you or someone in your family is feeling sick or tests positive for Covid that means everyone who has
                had close contact with the infected person may very well be carrying the virus. It is important for
                those who are symptomatic, or who have been exposed to the virus to stay away from others until the
                danger of spreading the virus is over. This means staying away from school until the danger of infecting
                others is past</p>
